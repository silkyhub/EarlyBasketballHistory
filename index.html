                <p> Basketball was created in 1891 by James Naismith a physical ed teacher. James was asked to create a sport that you could play indoors during the winter.
	           </p>
               <p>Naismith's sport was very different from the basketball we play every day, people still really liked it, they actually liked it so much that colleges around the US started to form leagues just in the first couple of years. </p>
                <p>Then the game got introduced to the rest of the world from efforts of the Army and the YMCA. </p>
                <p>The game was still a growing sport it didn't matter how popular it was. In the early 1900s it was included for an Olympic demonstration. Three decades later the game was then an Olympic sport, which the US team won. </p>
                <p>Basketball has been a major sport since the beginning. I feel like the reason it is, is because it has always been a worldwide sport that anybody could be good at if they put the practice time in. One example of that is when basketball became an Olympic sport, and another one is when college leagues started forming.</p>
