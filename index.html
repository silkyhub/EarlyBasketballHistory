                <p> Basketball was created in 1891 by James Naismith, a physical education teacher. James was asked to create a sport that you could play indoors during the winter.
	           </p>
               <p>Naismith's sport was very different from the basketball we play today. People really liked it, and they liked it so much that colleges around the U.S. started to form leagues within the first couple of years. </p>
                <p>Then the game was introduced to the rest of the world from efforts of the Army and the YMCA. </p>
                <p>The game was still a growing sport that was slowly gaining popularity.  In 1904, it was included for an Olympic demonstration. Just over three decades later, the game became an Olympic sport. The U.S. national team was the first country to win a gold medal in basketball. </p>
                <p>Basketball has been a major sport since the beginning. I feel like the reason is because college leagues started forming within the first decade of it being invented, and within a few decades it became an olympic sport.  Today it is one of the most popular sports.</p>
		<p> In my opinion, if you put the time and effort into getting better at basketball you will get better. </p>
